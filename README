Curent implementation status - generated qr codes on request, no auth, no update, no getqr, no sync

Register.qr opensource system

Principles:
1) ServerQRgen app - dedicated server to be integrated with the client's apps by using it's public API
2) LocalQRcheck - local app which is syncs with ServerQRgen with API and process the registration 

API of ServerQRgen:

Public: availble for the clients
https://host/api/v1/submit/ - gets information about newly registered user.
https://host/api/v1/update/ - update information about user
https://host/api/v1/getqr/ - get link to qr for already registered user

Self-Public: availbale only for LocalQRcheck 
https://host/sync/v1/submit - post json file to SeverQRgen to submit changes
https://host/sync/v1/get - get json file with fresh info from ServerQRgen

Auth
Client will be authorized with token-based auth. Token and Secret key are generated while registration of new client
Token should be added to every request, while secret key is used to sign the requests

Each LocalQRcheck installation should be registered within the customer and it will get it's own token and secret key
